# EV-Sales-Charging-Infrastructure
## Project Summary
Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming a critical component of sustainable transportation. However, EV adoption varies across regions, influenced by factors such as charging infrastructure availability, government incentives, and market development. This project analyzes global EV sales and charging infrastructure data to uncover patterns driving EV adoption and market growth.
## Data source
- Global EV sales data from the International Energy Agency
(IEA) (2014-2024).EV charging infrastructure statistics from
multiple national databases.
